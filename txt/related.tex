The Wikipedia project has several textual and tabular 
timelines\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_timelines}}. 
These are good examples of timelines we may visualise using tempuhs and 
mytimelines.org.

Our versions of those timelines are possibly superior for perusing in that 
they are visual and interactive -- but doubly interesting inasmuch as they are 
all just subsets of a gigantic timeline which may be dynamically updated per 
filters.
