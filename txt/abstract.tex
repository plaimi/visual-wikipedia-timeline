We can generate pleasant interactive timelines for most of the articles on 
Wikipedia. This is afforded through scraping DBpedia for semantic article 
data, putting it in tempuhs, and presenting it with mytimelines.org. The noble 
goal is an engrossing generic timeline of all of Wikipedia. As an added bonus, 
said timeline would be an excellent preview of the capabilities of 
mytimelines.org.
