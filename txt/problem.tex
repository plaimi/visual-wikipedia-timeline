DBpedia is an example of linked data, where structured data has been extracted 
from Wikipedia. This data may be semantically queried, and as such contains 
Wikipedia entries with metadata\cite{bizer2009dbpedia}.

DBpedia is designed for semantic querying of data, not presenting data. If 
permitted to beg the question: data becomes more useful if used. So let's use 
it.

Some of the entries have time-related metadata. This data might be more 
absorbing if presented as an interactive visualisation.
